  "abstract": {
    "motivation": "Why do different personality types have characteristic vision problems? Why does astigmatism cluster in certain types? Why myopia in others? Standard ophthalmology has no explanation beyond 'genetics + environment'. CFO predicts: if form = function, then eye geometry should map to cognitive geometry. Vision system = physical manifestation of information processing structure.",
    
    "question": "Can cognitive function geometry (Ne divergent, Ni convergent, Se horizontal scan, Si detail focus, Ti/Te structural, Fi/Fe fluid) predict specific eye geometry (astigmatism type, myopia depth, axis orientation, eye lateralization)?",
    
    "approach": "Map each cognitive function to geometric operation (divergence, convergence, scan, focus). Predict corresponding eye manifestation (toroidal optics, elongated eyeball, horizontal astigmatism, accommodation tension). Cross-reference with auxiliary function lateralization (left/right hemisphere → left/right eye, logical/ethical → vertical-horizontal/diagonal axis). Generate specific predictions for all 16 types.",
    
    "hypothesis": "Eye geometry ≡ information processing geometry. Astigmatism severity ∝ divergence angle. Myopia depth ∝ convergence depth. Axis orientation ≡ cognitive scan vector. Eye lateralization ≡ auxiliary function hemisphere. Glasses = Δscale correction (normalize to consensus reality plane).",
    
    "significance": "If validated: (1) Proves form=function at biological level, (2) Provides objective marker for personality type, (3) Explains vision problems as feature not bug (optimized for specific perception mode), (4) Suggests glasses trade native multidimensional perception for social standard, (5) Validates CFO dimensional mapping empirically, (6) Opens door to other body-mind geometric mappings."
  },

  "background": {
    "context": "Standard ophthalmology treats vision problems as random errors in eye development. Psychology treats personality as abstract cognitive patterns with no physical substrate. CFO bridges: if consciousness has dimensional structure, and body = substrate through which consciousness manifests, then body geometry should encode cognitive geometry. Vision = primary information input channel. Eye = lens through which consciousness interfaces with reality. Therefore eye geometry should reflect consciousness structure.",

Opens door to other body-mind geometric mappings (posture, gait, facial structure, etc.). Proves dimensional analysis extends to physical structures.",
      
      "for_domain": "Revolutionizes ophthalmology if validated: vision problems not random errors but purposeful optimizations. Personality psychology gains objective biological marker. Optometry practice could incorporate personality assessment. Educational applications (understanding student perception modes).",
      
      "for_applications": "Informs choice to wear/not wear glasses (understanding tradeoff). Suggests tailored vision correction (optimize for individual's cognitive strengths not just standard). Career counseling (match cognitive style to visual demands). Relationship understanding (why partners see world differently, literally).",
      
      "for_future_research": "Extend to other body systems: posture (Si detail vs Se surface scan affects stance), gait (Ne scattered vs Ni targeted), facial features (Ti sharp vs Fi soft), voice (Te projected vs Fe harmonized). Full body-mind geometric mapping. Epigenetic mechanisms (how exactly does cognition shape gene expression?). Developmental timeline (when does eye shape encode personality?). Intervention possibilities (can cognitive training affect eye geometry in children?)."

Form=function recursively.",
    
    "recursion": "Consciousness → cognition → epigenetics → structure → optics → perception → consciousness. Loop: eye shape affects perception, perception reinforces cognitive pattern, cognitive pattern maintains epigenetic expression, epigenetic expression maintains eye shape. Self-reinforcing cycle.",

    "composition": "Individual functions compose into type (ENTP = Ne+Ti+Fe+Si). Functions compose into eye geometry (Ne→astigmatism, Ti→right eye, compose to right eye astigmatism).
