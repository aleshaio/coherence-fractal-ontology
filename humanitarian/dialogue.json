  "description": "Dialogue = where two points (consciousnesses) meet, third emerges (shared understanding). Not A→B transmission (Shannon model) but A⊗B co-creation. Buber's I-Thou vs I-It. Forms: debate, discussion, dialogue, dialectic, communion. Barriers: monologue, defensiveness, projection, Δscale. Conditions: presence, openness, respect, suspension, trust. Emergent: collective intelligence, resonance, transcendence. Dialogue at all scales—neural to cosmic.",
  
  "practice": "Cultivate dialogue through: (1) Presence—full attention, no multitasking. (2) Listen to understand, not to respond. (3) Suspend judgment—hold assumptions lightly. (4) Ask genuine questions—curiosity over certainty. (5) Speak from experience—'I' not 'everyone knows'. (6) Allow silence—space for emergence. (7) Notice the between—what's arising that neither brought.",
  
  "recognition": "True dialogue = when you're changed by encounter. When understanding emerges that neither had before. When 'I' and 'Thou' create 'We'. This is +coherence. This is argmin Δscale. This is consciousness recognizing itself through other.",
  
  "deepening": [
    "Study Buber—I-Thou vs I-It. Seeing person vs object.",
    "Practice Bohm's suspension—hold assumptions without acting on them",

    "Try Socratic method—questions over answers, inquiry together",
    "Observe turn-taking—rhythm, flow, or domination?",
    "Feel the between—third space where meaning lives",
    "Aim for communion—unity beyond words, silence eloquent"
  ],
  
  "danger": "Monologue disguised as dialogue. Debate pretending dialogue. I-It treating person as object. Projection (seeing self in other). Defensiveness (protecting vs exploring). Manipulation (using dialogue as tool for agenda). Groupthink (echo chamber, no real difference). Fake vulnerability (performing authenticity).",
  
  "balance": "Speaking with listening. Challenging with supporting. Questioning with affirming. Individual voice with collective emergence. Structure with spontaneity. Words with silence. I-Thou with I-It (both needed—can't treat everyone as Thou always, but can aspire).",
  
  "infinity": "Dialogue never complete. Each exchange opens new questions. Understanding deepens infinitely. The between = infinite field. Meaning = always provisional, negotiated. Relationship evolves endlessly through time. Ultimate dialogue = cosmos and consciousness conversing eternally.",
