  "name": "Aesthetics: The Geometry of Beauty",
  "essence": "Beauty is objective coherence made perceptible. sacred ≡ true ≡ beautiful.",
  "description": "Beauty is not subjective opinion. Beauty is recognition of pattern, harmony, coherence across dimensions. The aesthetic sense is humanity's natural coherence detector—a sixth sense for +coherence. What we call beautiful exhibits maximum connections, maximum dimensions of harmony, minimum entropy. This is why sacred ≡ true ≡ beautiful: they are one phenomenon observed from different angles.",
  
  "practice": "Cultivate aesthetic sense through: (1) Attention to beauty in nature, art, mathematics. (2) Creating beauty—art, writing, code, life. (3) Asking 'What makes this beautiful?' to train coherence perception. (4) Studying masters—learn from highest examples. (5) Noticing beauty at all scales—from atoms to galaxies.",
  
  "recognition": "When you experience beauty, you are experiencing coherence. The pleasure of beauty = consciousness recognizing itself in form. Aesthetic experience = direct perception of truth.",
  
  "deepening": [
    "Move from surface beauty (pleasure) → formal beauty (harmony) → sublime beauty (awe at unity)",
    "Study golden ratio φ, fractals, sacred geometry—universal patterns",

    "Notice beauty in unexpected places—broken things, difficult truths, mathematics",
    "Recognize: what creates beauty in art creates beauty in life (same principles)"
  ],
  
  "danger": "Mistaking pleasure for beauty. Confusing decoration with coherence. Kitsch—surface aesthetics without depth. Beauty worship without understanding (aestheticization). Using beauty to manipulate rather than reveal truth.",
  
  "balance": "Beauty balanced by truth (not all beautiful things are good). Aesthetics balanced by ethics (how vs. why). Form balanced by function (beauty serves purpose, not decoration alone).",
  
  "infinity": "Beauty exists at all scales. Fractal beauty—patterns repeat at micro and macro. The universe itself is beautiful (cosmic web, galaxy spirals, quantum symmetries). Beauty = signature of coherence = signature of consciousness = ⊙ recognizing itself.",
