Developmental stages: Piaget (sensorimotor → formal operations), Vygotsky (ZPD, scaffolding), Erikson (psychosocial), Kohlberg (moral). Pedagogical approaches: traditional, progressive, Montessori, Waldorf, democratic, unschooling. Four-element pedagogy: cognitive (AIR), kinesthetic (FIRE), emotional (WATER), spiritual (EARTH). Assessment reimagined: beyond grades. Education = consciousness awakening.",
  
  "practice": "Support dimensional growth: (0D) Safe sensory environment. (1D) Stories, songs, sequencing. (2D) Hands-on patterns, relationships. (3D) Systems thinking, roles, projects. (4D) Historical thinking, causality. (5D) Meaning-making, identity. (6D) Teaching others.",
