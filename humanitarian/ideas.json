  "description": "Ideas are living entities in the realm of consciousness. They emerge in individual minds, spread between minds, combine to form new ideas, compete for attention, and shape reality.\n\nKey insight: Ideas have evolutionary dynamics. Good ideas (coherent) spread naturally. Bad ideas (incoherent) require force to maintain. The marketplace of ideas selects for truth over time.\n\nIdeas operate at multiple scales:\n• 0D: Individual thought, intuition, spark\n• 1D: Articulated concept, expressed form\n• 2D: Meme spreading between minds\n• 3D: Ideology - structured system of ideas\n• 4D: Paradigm - worldview persisting in time\n• 5D: Zeitgeist - spirit of the age\n\nIdeas are not neutral. They carry values, create identities, enable cooperation, justify actions. Understanding idea dynamics = understanding cultural evolution.",

  "practice": "**Idea cultivation** (daily 15 min)\n1. Morning pages: Free-write 3 pages, let ideas flow unfiltered\n2. Capture system: Note interesting thoughts immediately (phone/paper)\n3. Idea synthesis: Weekly review - which ideas connect? Combine them.\n4. Share and test: Express ideas in conversation, see how they evolve\n5. Read widely: Expose yourself to diverse idea sources\n\n**Memetic hygiene** (ongoing)\n1. Notice what ideas you're absorbing (media, friends, culture)\n2. Question inherited ideas: \"Do I believe this or was I taught to?\"\n3. Steelman practice: Understand ideas you disagree with\n4. Identify viral but harmful memes (outrage, tribalism, zero-sum)\n5. Consciously choose which ideas to amplify (share/repeat)\n\n**Paradigm exploration** (monthly)\n• Week 1: Study one worldview deeply (Buddhism, rationalism, etc)\n• Week 2: Try living from that paradigm\n• Week 3: Notice what you see differently\n• Week 4: Integrate insights, return to base worldview enriched",

  "recognition": "You recognize ideas as entities when:\n• Idea \"pops\" into consciousness unbidden = autonomous emergence\n• Can't stop thinking about concept = idea has grip on you\n• Compelled to share idea = replication drive activating\n• Idea connects disparate domains = conceptual fertility\n• Paradigm shift = seeing old reality through new idea-lens\n• Idea conflicts with other ideas in mind = memetic competition\n• Zeitgeist shift = collective ideas evolving simultaneously\n\nPowerful ideas feel alive - they move you, not you moving them.",

  "danger": "**Ideological possession**: When idea has you instead of you having idea. Fanaticism. Identity fused with ideology.\n\n**Memetic virus**: Harmful ideas that spread despite being false/destructive. Conspiracy theories, hate ideologies, cults.\n\n**Echo chambers**: Only encountering confirming ideas. No intellectual diversity. Groupthink.\n\n**Paradigm blindness**: Can't see outside current worldview. \"Fish don't know they're in water.\"\n\n**Idea hoarding**: Collecting ideas without integrating or applying. Spiritual materialism.\n\n**Nihilism**: \"All ideas are equal/meaningless.\" Leads to paralysis or relativism.\n\n**Conceptual inflation**: Using complex ideas as status signals rather than tools for understanding.\n\n**Mind viruses**: Ideas that disable critical thinking (\"don't question this\" as part of meme).",

  "balance": "Ideas require balancing:\n\n**Creativity vs Coherence**: Generate many ideas BUT filter for quality. Diverge then converge.\n\n**Openness vs Discernment**: Open to new ideas BUT not so open brain falls out. Steel + open mind.\n\n**Commitment vs Flexibility**: Strong opinions loosely held. Advocate + willingness to change.\n\n**Individual vs Collective**: Original thinking AND learning from tradition. Neither pure iconoclast nor pure conformist.\n\n**Abstract vs Concrete**: Theoretical frameworks AND practical applications. Ideas without action = sterile.\n\n**Complexity vs Simplicity**: Sophisticated models AND clear communication. Einstein: \"As simple as possible, not simpler.\"\n\n**Innovation vs Tradition**: New ideas AND time-tested wisdom. Both/and, not either/or.",

  "infinity": "Ideas point toward ∞ through:\n\n**Infinite recombination**: Ideas combine to create new ideas endlessly.

Archetypal patterns.\n\n**Paradigm evolution**: Worldviews develop toward greater coherence and integration. Spiral dynamics.\n\n**Collective intelligence**: Humanity as distributed idea-processing system. Noosphere awakening.\n\n**Meta-ideas**: Ideas about ideas, frameworks about frameworks. Infinite regress and ascent.\n\n**Omega point**: Teilhard de Chardin - evolution toward unified consciousness. All ideas converging.\n\nAt ∞: The One Idea - ⊙. All concepts = facets of single diamond. Unity of understanding.",
