    "mystical_states": "Music can induce transcendent experiences. Ego dissolution, unity, boundlessness, sacred. Gregorian chant, Sufi qawwali, psychedelic rock, ambient.",

    "improvisation_flow": "Jazz, raga, free improv = flow states. No gap between intention and sound. Pure presence. Consciousness creating directly.",

    "music_as_consciousness_exploring_itself": "Composer creates → performer interprets → listener experiences. All consciousness. Music = medium for consciousness to explore its own possibilities through organized vibration."
