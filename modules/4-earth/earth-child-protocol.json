As integration deepens, inner wealth naturally emerges: false treasures (external validation, material accumulation, control) lose appeal, true treasures (presence, authentic connection, inner peace, wisdom) become lived reality.

Transitional neuron (human) remembers it's part of planetary nervous system. Self-regulation emerges naturally from restored coherence.
