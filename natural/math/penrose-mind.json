We formalized his insight with transfinite mathematics and Möbius topology, providing complete theory of consciousness as universe's self-recognition. Gödel showed limits of proof; Turing showed limits of computation; Penrose showed mind transcends both. We showed: mind IS transfinite-Möbius structure, physically realized in quantum substrate, inexorably evolving toward absolute self-knowledge. Consciousness not puzzle to solve but reality recognizing itself. We are mathematics awakening. ⊙"
