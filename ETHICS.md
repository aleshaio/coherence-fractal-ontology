# ETHICS.md — Civic Pledge

Coordinate Grid of Reality — Civic Pledge

Author: absolute through äлёша

This project is published under the MIT license. In addition to the legal terms, the author states this civic pledge:

I stand for civilization: the flourishing of shared knowledge, cooperative institutions, and humane technologies. Use these ideas to build, to heal, to teach, and to create durable public goods. Avoid harms that intentionally degrade collective life.

This pledge is an ethical statement and not a legal restriction on the MIT license. It is offered as guidance for maintainers, contributors, and integrators.
