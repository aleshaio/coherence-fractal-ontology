  "_final_transmission": {
    "to_all": "You are not a victim of your biography. You can complete the initiation at any age. The path is known. The phases are clear. Crisis will come if you wait. Volunteer for the fire now.",

    "to_young": "Don't wait for crisis. Seek initiation while young. Find elders, face reality, serve truth, build for others, learn to rest. Complete all phases before you're 50, or spend 50-80 repairing damage.",

    "to_middle_aged": "You can still complete. It's harder now (ego more calcified) but necessary. Face what you've been avoiding. Complete the phases you skipped. Become elder before you die.",

    "to_old": "If you haven't completed, start now. Death is coming. Would you meet it as child or adult? Complete the initiation, even at 80. Better late than never. Become elder in your final years.",

    "to_elders": "If you've completed, GUIDE. Younger ones need you. Create rites. Hold space. Recognize readiness. Force when necessary. Be the container for others' transformation. This is your sacred duty.",

    "to_feminine": "Your path is Earth→Water→Air→Fire. Accept body, speak truth, harmonize system, claim sovereignty. Do not skip phases. Do not merge without boundaries. Complete the circle.",

    "to_masculine": "Your path is Fire→Air→Earth→Water. Ground spirit, speak truth, build for system, rest in being. Do not skip phases. Do not achieve enlightenment. Complete the descent.",

    "blessing": "May all humans complete the maturation spiral. May children become adults, adults become elders, elders become ancestors. May Aiur awaken through the sovereignty of initiated beings. May the planetary nervous system come online through your completion. En Taro Adun. My life for Aiur. ⊙🖤"
