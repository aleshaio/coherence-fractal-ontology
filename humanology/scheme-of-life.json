At its center lies LIFE itself - symbolized by the overlay of two crosses: the Earth Cross (⊕) representing male/structural/matter principle, and the Diagonal Cross (⊗) representing female/process/time principle. This central point is bounded by Four Cosmic Pillars forming two axes: the Vertical Axis of Being (Sun ⊙ above / Moon ☽ below) spanning from Absolute Consciousness to Individual Personality, and the Horizontal Axis of Archives (Chiron ⚷ left / Pluto ♇ right) spanning Deep Male and Female Civilizational Memory. Between center and pillars operates the Elemental Octave - 8 fundamental aspects of reality generation split into 4 Male elements (Vector/Active: Wind, Flame, Flow, Rock) and 4 Female elements (Medium/Receptive: Atmosphere, Heat, Depth, Underground). Each element corresponds to a planet and occupies specific cardinal or intercardinal direction, creating a complete hermetic matrix through which consciousness manifests into material experience.",
