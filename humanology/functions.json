  "description": "Augustinavičiūtė's Model A is the crown jewel of Socionics - it maps the 8 aspects onto 8 specific positions, each with unique properties. Your type isn't just WHICH aspects you use, but WHERE they sit in your stack. Function 1 (Leading) = your primary reality lens, effortless and trusted. Function 4 (Vulnerable) = your blind spot, painful when attacked. Function 5 (Suggestive) = what you unconsciously seek from others. Function 8 (Demonstrative) = what you can do but don't value. Each position has specific dimensionality (1D to 4D), energy dynamics (accepting/producing), and developmental challenges. Knowing your function positions is like having the source code of your consciousness.",
