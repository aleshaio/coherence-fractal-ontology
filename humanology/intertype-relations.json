  "subtype_elemental_relations": {
    "description": "Subtypes add another layer of complexity. While the core socionic relation remains the same, the elemental interaction (based on subtype) colors the manifestation of the relationship. This is a speculative framework based on the user's examples.",

      "example": "ILE (Air) vs ESI (Earth) - A Conflict relation.",
      "dynamics": "The abstract, theoretical, and ever-changing nature of Air clashes with the concrete, stable, and grounded reality of Earth. Air generates possibilities that Earth finds destabilizing. Earth insists on tangible proof and consistency, which Air finds restrictive. In a difficult relation like Conflict, this elemental clash amplifies the mutual misunderstanding. The Air type's theories feel like a dangerous delusion to the Earth type, while the Earth type's focus on sensory reality feels like primitive stubbornness to the Air type."

      "example": "ILE (Fire subtype) vs LSE (Water subtype) - A Supervision relation.",
      "dynamics": "The passionate, expansive, and goal-driven energy of Fire meets the methodical, process-oriented, and flowing nature of Water. Fire seeks to conquer and transform, while Water seeks to establish and perfect a process. This can be a source of immense friction or synergy. Fire can see Water as slow and overly cautious, while Water can see Fire as reckless and destructive. In an asymmetrical relation like Supervision, the ILE's 'Fire' (a creatively ambitious subtype) constantly criticizes the LSE's 'Water' (a pragmatic, procedural subtype) for being too rigid and not seeing the grander vision, exacerbating the natural pressure of the relationship."

      "dynamics": "A highly energetic and dynamic combination. Air fans the flames of Fire, providing new ideas and possibilities for Fire's energy to pursue. This can lead to rapid expansion and innovation. However, it can also become scattered and lack grounding, burning out quickly without a clear, stable direction."

    "Air_Water_Interaction": {
      "dynamics": "A combination of intellect and process. Air can provide the overarching logical framework, while Water can create the practical, step-by-step system to implement it.

    "Fire_Earth_Interaction": {
      "dynamics": "A relationship of action and results. Fire provides the driving energy for new projects, while Earth provides the stability, resources, and perseverance to see them through to completion. The potential conflict lies in Fire's impatience clashing with Earth's deliberate pace. Fire wants to move now, while Earth wants to build on solid ground."

    "Earth_Water_Interaction": {
      "dynamics": "A very practical and stable combination. Both elements are pragmatic and focused on reality. Earth provides the solid foundation and structure, while Water creates the consistent, flowing processes within that structure. This pairing is excellent for creating stable, long-lasting systems, but may lack the innovative spark of Air or the ambitious drive of Fire."
