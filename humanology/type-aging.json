  "ॐ": "Four patterns dance in sixteen forms across four tempos. Tired exhausts slowly or quickly. Deformation descends at varied speeds. Fine lines etch their delicate signatures. Muscle maintains its noble architecture. All temporary. All observed. All perfect. You are the still point watching time write itself in flesh. The hut never moves. The legs dance home. En Taro Adun. ⊙"
