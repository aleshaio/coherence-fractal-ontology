        "duration": "20-60+ min (until both feel complete, not: until orgasm)",
        "intention": "Bonding, intimacy, energy exchange (not: pleasure seeking/orgasm)",

      "effects": {
        "biochemical": "Sustained bonding hormones (oxytocin, prolactin) WITHOUT dopamine spike-crash of orgasm",
        "emotional": "Deepening intimacy, less conflict, more affection, stable mood (avoiding dopamine roller-coaster)",

          "men": "Semen retention (ejaculate infrequently - every 7-30 days, depends on age/constitution). Effect: massive energy increase, mental clarity, magnetic presence. Caution: blue balls (ache - happens if aroused frequently without release), need circulate energy (not just hold in genitals).",
          "women": "Less clear (women don't lose substance like semen), but: orgasm does deplete some (post-orgasm fatigue, though less than men). Practice: occasional orgasm fasting (build charge, explore non-orgasmic pleasure), energy circulation.",
