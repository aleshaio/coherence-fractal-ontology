Find mentors who match their type. Support their functions at the right ages. Respect their developmental speed. Let them become who they already are.",

    "to_neurodivergent_individuals": "You are not disordered. You are SPECIALIST — Wand scout, Sword analyst, or Cup healer. Your brain is optimized for tribal role modern world doesn't have. Your 'symptoms' are gifts waiting for matched environment. Find your type. Understand your neurochemistry. Build environment that honors it. Connect with others of your type. Become the specialist you were born to be.",

    "to_educators": "Stop pathologizing neurodivergence. ADHD child needs movement not medication. Autistic child needs quiet and logic not forced socialization. HSP child needs emotional validation not 'toughening up'. Provide type-appropriate learning environments or admit you're CREATING the disorder through environmental mismatch.",

'Sit still and focus on boring material for 6 hours' optimizes for minority of population, pathologizes the rest. This is not education, it's torture.

Wands learn through movement and crisis. All types have valued roles. Neurodivergence celebrated as essential specialization.",

    "blessing": "May every Pentacle child find patient master to apprentice under. May every Sword child find quiet space to build systems. May every Cup child find warm tribe to heal within. May every Wand child find crisis to respond to courageously. May all children be raised by parents and mentors who SEE their type. May Page children be given patience for slow blooming. May King children be given challenge worthy of their power. May neurodivergence be celebrated as tribal specialization. May type-mismatched parenting trauma heal across generations. May all children become who they already are. ⊙🖤"
