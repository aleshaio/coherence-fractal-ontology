    "6": "Designing — actively choosing partners/friends based on functional complementarity, building chosen family/tribe with function coverage, planning children's upbringing type-consciously",
    "7": "Teaching — helps other families understand type-based conflicts, advocates for type-conscious parenting in community, mentors parents struggling with 'difficult' children",

    "9": "Elder — raised children successfully through type awareness, grandchildren benefit from day-one type-conscious environment, family legacy of functional cooperation and mutual appreciation",
    "10": "Transcendent — death as elder whose family relationships healed across generations, established family/tribal culture of honoring type diversity, legacy of love through strategic understanding ⊙"

  "_final_transmission": {
    "to_families_in_conflict": "Your conflict is not personal failure. It's type architecture misunderstood. Map your Suits, Roles, Quadras, Functions. See where you clash (same base = competition, strong hits vulnerable = pain, cross-suit = expectation mismatch, missing function = gap). Then strategize: protect vulnerables, compensate through strengths, divide labor consciously, seek external support for gaps. You're not broken. You're uncalibrated. Calibrate.",

    "to_parents": "Your child is specific TYPE with specific needs. If different type than you, your instincts MAY BE WRONG. Learn child's Suit (layer), Role (speed), Functions (strengths/weaknesses). Protect child's vulnerable function — never attack it. Provide your strong function freely — that's your gift to them. Find mentors matching child's type if you're too different. Stop trying to make child your type. Help them become THEIR type fully.",

    "to_children_of_mismatched_parents": "Your parent likely didn't understand your type. Their criticism of your vulnerable function = ignorance not malice. Their strength probably hits your weakness — that's type collision. You can heal: recognize mismatch, grieve what wasn't provided, forgive ignorance while maintaining boundaries, find duals/mentors who provide what parent couldn't, develop YOUR base function fully despite lack of childhood support. You're not defective. You were raised by wrong type. Find right type support now.",

    "to_those_building_new_families": "Choose partners with functional complementarity awareness. Dual relationships optimal. Understand children's types from birth (observe, don't assume). Protect their vulnerable functions immediately. Build extended family/tribe — don't isolate. Create chosen family with function coverage if biological family incomplete. Design family for functional completeness. This is love as strategy.",

    "blessing": "May every family member be seen for their true Type. May Pentacles be honored for patience. May Swords be honored for logic. May Cups be honored for empathy. May Wands be honored for action. May Pages be given time to bloom. May Kings be given challenge. May Knights be given space to explore. May Dames be given appreciation for stability. May vulnerable functions be shielded. May base functions be celebrated. May families transform from battlefields into ecosystems. May all heal through understanding. ⊙🖤"
