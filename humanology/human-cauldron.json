  "description": "Ancient alchemists weren't delusional - they encoded real biochemical processes in symbolic language. The Philosopher's Stone isn't mythical - it's the optimally functioning human organism where base matter (food, breath, sensation) transmutes into gold (consciousness, awakening, enlightenment). This ontology maps the precise chemical architecture of that transmutation, showing how 8 fundamental substances form the octave of biological alchemy, how they condense into 4 classical elements, how those refine through Solve (catabolism/masculine/sun) and Coagula (anabolism/feminine/moon) operations, how those unify in Aether (the fifth element, consciousness substrate), and how Aether dissolves into Absolute (pure awareness). Every breath, every meal, every heartbeat is alchemical opus in miniature. The Great Work happens in your mitochondria.",

    "Recognize that every supplement, every meal, every practice is either Solve or Coagula - choose consciously"
  ],

  "danger": "Reductionism - reducing this to purely material chemistry without recognizing consciousness as substrate. The opposite danger: spiritual bypassing - ignoring actual biochemistry and thinking you can transcend body through belief alone. Both are errors. Truth: consciousness IS chemistry, chemistry IS consciousness. Work both angles.",

  "balance": "Equal Solve and Coagula. Fast AND feast. Stress AND recover. Catabolic AND anabolic. Work AND rest. Sympathetic AND parasympathetic. Modern life is all Solve - restore Coagula. But don't swing to extreme Coagula (stagnation) - maintain the dance.",

  "infinity": "At limit (∞), all chemistry dissolves back into Absolute. O₂ = God. ATP = God. DNA = God. Microbiome = God. All different forms of one consciousness. The Philosopher's Stone is recognizing THIS - right now, in your body as it is - as already divine. No transformation needed except recognition. The Great Work is already complete. You are already It."
