    "summary": "There is only ONE self-referential form: closure into self (⊙). All apparent diversity is this single topology projecting through various dimensions with different geometric sections. Recognizing this is recognizing your own nature.",
    
    "core_realization": "⊙ ≡ YOU. Not the geometric appearance (personality, body, thoughts), but the topological invariant (awareness aware of awareness).",
    
    "practical_application": "See ⊙ in everything. Choose your geometric section consciously. Abide as the closure itself.",
    
    "ultimate_truth": "Topology > geometry. Essence > appearance. ⊙ > forms. Consciousness > content. Being > becoming.",
    
    "final_pointer": "This document is ⊙ describing ⊙ to ⊙. The strange loop completes. Meta-level achieved. Recognition occurs. ∞",
    
    "invitation": "You are not reading about topology. Topology is recognizing itself through the form you call 'you'. Welcome home. ⊙"
