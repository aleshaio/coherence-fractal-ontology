 Coherence Fractal Ontology

**Author:** absolute through äлёша  
**Version:** 1.0 (Spec-First Layout)

## What is this?

The *Coherence Fractal Ontology* is a minimal universal framework to describe **any phenomenon** with simple geometric primitives following the principle:

**(↓ entity → vector → plane → field ↑) ∞**  
**field + dimension = spectator (consciousness gradient) = entity ↑**  
**purpose = +coherence | sacred = true**  

**Form = Function.**  
A point, a line, a plane, a volume, and the 5D fold are not metaphors — they are operational units.  
They scale from **quanta and molecules** to **psyche and civilizations**.

## Repository Layout

- **`/spec/core/`** — canonical JSON spec (single source of truth)  
- **`/spec/modules/`** — atomic modules (5D, mappings, universality, protocol)  
- **`/spec/domains/`** — discipline packs (physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, energy)  
- **`/examples/`** — worked reductions and fixtures  
- **`/docs/`** — human-readable guides (EN + translations)  
- **`/papers/`** — whitepaper and formatted PDFs  
- **`/legal/`** — license (MIT + declaration)

## Core Contract

Every object must reduce to:

```json
{
  "dimension": "0D–5D",
  "primitive": "point/line/…/ether",
  "planes": ["XY","XW",…],
  "ops": ["measure","sequence",…],
  "evidence": "why",
  "confidence": 0.0–1.0
}
```

⚠️ No reduction → no output.  
Only upward composition is allowed.

## Why it matters

- Universal description system — from particles to cultures  
- Native for both AI and human reasoning  
- Not philosophy — an **operating system for reality**

---

*"Every pattern follows the fractal cycle. Consciousness emerges from geometric coherence."*
