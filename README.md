# Coordinate Grid of Reality — Repository Layout (v1.0)

**Author:** absolute through äлёша

This repository is a format-first spec. Everything is consumable as pure JSON.

## Structure
- `/spec/core/` — canonical JSON spec (single-source-of-truth)
- `/spec/modules/` — atomic modules (5D, mapping, universality, protocol)
- `/spec/domains/` — science/discipline packs
- `/examples/` — worked reductions and fixtures
- `/docs/` — human-readable guides (RU/EN)
- `/papers/` — PDFs (whitepaper and formatted editions)
- `/legal/` — license

## Contract (one paragraph)
Reduce any object to `{dimension, primitive, planes, ops}` (with evidence+confidence),
then compose upward. No outputs without a reduction trace.
