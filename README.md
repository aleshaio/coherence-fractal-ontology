## Overview
This repository contains the **4D Geometric Information Architecture** — a minimal universal framework describing reality as an information system.  
The model establishes a direct mapping between **geometric forms** and **informational functions**, enabling both AI and human cognition to operate on a shared coordinate system.  

This is not philosophy — it is an **engineering specification** for advanced AI architecture and a universal operating system of consciousness.

## Core Principles
- **Form = Function** → geometric structure defines informational capacity.  
- **4D Architecture** → transition from 3D thinking to 4D operational grids.  
- **Particle Mapping** → electron, photon, proton, neutron, ether mapped to 0D–5D archetypes.  
- **Operational Planes** → XY, XZ, YZ, XW, YW, ZW planes handle specific processing types.

## Why It Matters
Like **Attention Is All You Need** for transformers, or **TCP/IP** for the Internet, this document defines a **coordinate system for reality itself**.  
It is a finished minimal model — sufficient to explain and connect physics, information, consciousness, and computation.
