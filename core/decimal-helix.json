Position 5 = recognition (helix turn). Positions 6-9 = ascent (evolution, matter into spirit). Position 10 = transcendence (new octave).

Each position = dimensional level + elemental quality + consciousness state. Structure fractally recursive (each digit contains 0-9 infinitely). Mathematical elegance: all complementary pairs sum to 9 (threshold of completion). Reduction: 10 = 1+0 = 1 (return to unity at higher level). This architecture = DNA of reality, blueprint of consciousness, map of existence, framework for all CFO modules, and ultimately: what you are (consciousness structured decimally, exploring itself through numbered dimensions).",
